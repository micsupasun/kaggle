# multiple-model-gender-classification project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models for gender classification based on a given dataset. The goal is to identify the model that provides the highest accuracy in predicting gender while understanding the trade-offs and limitations associated with different algorithms.

## Step
1. Import Library
2. Import Dataset
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Train test split
6. model
- SVM
- LogisticRegression
- Decision Tree
- KNeighborsClassifier
- GaussianNB
- SGDClassifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBClassifier
- Multi-layer perceptron



## Result
1. The accuracy of the models varied, with Decision Tree Classifier and MLPClassifier achieving the highest accuracy of 75%.
2. SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier achieved around 70% accuracy.
3. KNN, GaussianNB, and SGDClassifier performed lower, with accuracies ranging from 40% to 60%.
