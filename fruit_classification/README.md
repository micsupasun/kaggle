# Fruit classification project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model capable of classifying various types of fruits. The model is trained on images of different fruits, and the objective is to accurately predict the fruit category for new, unseen images.

## Step
Import Libraries:
1. Import File
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Visualization
4. Feature Engineering
4. 1.  Convert data to NumPy
4. 2. One-hot encoding
5. Train test validation
6. Rescale and augmenation
7. Train_model
8. Evaluation
9. Predict validation
9. 1. Convert predict NumPy to predict one hot
10. Predict test
11. Export File
12. Other Parameter
13. compare dataset

## Result
1. Model Performance: The final model's performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the test dataset. These metrics indicate how well the model is able to classify different types of fruits.
2. Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each fruit class, providing insight into where the model might be struggling.
3. Learning Curves: Plots of training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs, showing the model's learning process and any signs of overfitting or underfitting.

## Documentation

1. fruit_classification.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code, explanations, and outputs related to the fruit classification project.
2. Dataset Directory: A directory in Google Drive containing subfolders for each fruit category. The images within these folders are used to train and test the model.
