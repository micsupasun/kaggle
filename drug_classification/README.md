# Drug classification project

## Objective
The objective of the Drug Classification project is to develop a machine-learning model that can classify different types of drugs based on various features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical information. This classification can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about drug prescriptions.

## Step
1. Import Library
2. Import Dataset
3. Data Preprocessing
4. EDA
5. Feature Engineering
6. Train test split
7. Train model
- SVM
- LogisticRegression
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- Random Forest

## Result
1. Model Performance: The results should include the performance metrics of the classification model, indicating how well it can predict the type of drug based on the given features.
2. Feature Importance: The project might highlight the most important features that influence drug classification.
3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix will likely show the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class.
